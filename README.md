# The (it's not official yet!) IronLand MicroNation's Technology Department
3rd October 2025: Well, I heard that there's a micronation, so I immediately decided that instead of building boring websites, I will build technology for IronLand.
                  In my humble opinion, I think that this can be used for developing the official website for IronLand.
